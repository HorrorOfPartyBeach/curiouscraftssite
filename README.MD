# **Cabinet of Curious Crafts**

Local crafts company, Cabinet of Curious Crafts has asked me to build a website showcasing the creative crochet products they make. This site is being built with React.js and React Bootstrap to make it mobile responsive and accessible. Webpack and Babel will ensure it is cross-browser compatible. It is being developed with accessibility in mind and will be tested with screenreaders and other accessibility tools as it progresses.
